 #Origin
 dionysian_origin: "Tyranny"
 dionysian_origin_desc: "A very small number of elites possess transcendent power. This civilization is ruled by the strongest psychic since ancient times, the immortal Overlord."
 DIONYSIAN_START_SCREEN: "The civilization of [GetSpeciesName] is intricately woven with mystical forces. A few among us possess long lives and extraordinary psychic powers. These sporadic Archons almost dictate the changes and developments in society and history, as well as the rise and fall of nations and peoples.\n\nIn Year 0, the Overlord established our Empire that endures to this day. [GetRulerName] initiated conquests that swept across the vast lands, gradually unifying [GetHomeWorldName]. The compliant Archons ascended into the ruling class, while those who resisted were forced into seclusion.\n\nDuring the medieval period, most regions were ruled by Archons, mostly governing independently and sometimes engaging in conflicts. In the modern era, the centralization of our Empire increased gradually but was simultaneously challenged by democratic revolutions.\n\nNow, with the invention of FTL drive, the distant stars we gaze upon are within reach, awaiting exploration and conquest."

 #Election
 dionysian_election.0.name: "Imminent Election"
 dionysian_election.0.desc: "Generally, the parliament should hold elections every ten years, leading to the appointment of a new Chancellor and Cabinet members. Political parties have already activated their propaganda machinery, rallying the masses, and political issues are increasingly prevalent in the news media. Demonstrations and speeches occasionally appear on every street corner, with fringe factions and extremist groups gaining some ground. Hearts and minds are in flux, contradictions arise, and debates intersect. The nation will momentarily have little respite, deliberate manipulation and fraud could lead to more severe consequences.\n\nThe ultimate winner must find a way to stand firm, perhaps through appropriate compromise and reconciliation, or maybe by taking a strong stance to suppress dissent. Otherwise, chaos may become inevitable."

 #Archon
 dionysian_base.15.name: "Rise of an Archon"
 dionysian_base.15.desc: "§HAscendant Psychic§!\n\nThe Archons hold high positions and significant roles, all possessing extraordinary power. However, our Empire is rife with factions, and these overmans have long-held contradiction. If one Archon is to be elevated to the pinnacle of our government, careful consideration is essential. This individual stands out as a leader among them, enjoys widespread favor, and faces no apparent obstacles in their ascent.\n"

 dionysian_base.15.a: "Your unique trait has increased the upkeep."
 dionysian_base.15.a.response: "Indeed. In the past, the Archons were mostly luxurious and indulgent imperial lords, although our privileges have been reduced in the modern era. As long-lived beings, our struggles and conflicts endure for extended periods and are intense. Furthermore, the common populace is no longer restricted in information; with technological advancements, they have become particularly sensitive and united, while we remain consistently visible.\n\n§EAscension Perk §HImperial Theogony§! can reduce Archon's upkeep significantly, but it requires another adopted Ascension Perk.§!\n"
 dionysian_base.15.b: "Is there only one Archon for each kind of power?"
 dionysian_base.15.b.response: "Yes. Unless I perish, there won't be another Archon of the same kind. It's like a territory that is currently under my control.\n\n§EThe §Htrait's name§! shows the domain of current Archon.§!\n"
 dionysian_base.15.c: "How does an ordinary leader become an Archon?"
 dionysian_base.15.c.response: "Our race has a trait where ordinary individuals gradually gain psychic powers in the process of achieving great deeds. This is the most common path to Ascension; many of my colleagues have followed this route.\n\n§EIncrease the §Hskill level§! of ordinary leaders. They have a chance of becoming Archons in this process.\n"
 dionysian_base.15.d: "Will the current event occur multiple times?"
 dionysian_base.15.d.response: "We all swear to fight for the glory of [root.GetRulerName], but our differences in specific approaches are quite severe. The Overlord often needs to put in considerable effort to ensure unified support for a certain Archon to run this nation.\n\n§EEvery once in a while, a new Archon can be hired. The §HChancellor§! might also be an Archon.\n"
 dionysian_base.15.e: "Will your initial level increase?"
 dionysian_base.15.e.response: "We're not yet fully acquainted with the entirely new scenario of space; many are still employing traditional methods from the past few hundred years to address issues. Some individuals, of course, are unwilling to work on science ships, and a few hardliners refuse to interact with computers. Give us some more time to adapt, and the situation will eventually improve.\n\n§EThe §Hinitial level§! of Archons will increase over time.§!\n"

 dionysian_base.15.destiny: "§YIt seems quite comfortable to control destiny.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.destiny.response: "With just a thought from me, pedestrians might be smashed into minced meat by falling objects from the buildings, and beauties might pour out their love to beggars on the roadside. I can repeatedly make big profits at the casino and winning the lottery is not difficult at all. But I also encounter unexpected situations, unsure whether they are purely accidental or if I inadvertently unleashed psychic powers. Perhaps causality is just an illusion, and I have had this feeling for a long time."
 dionysian_base.15.time: "§YTo what extent can you manipulate time?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.time.response: "The most typical application is to rewind time. I can replay this conversation dozens of times, gradually selecting the wording that elicits the best response from the audience. Ordinary people only have the concept of 'save' and 'load' in games, while I repeatedly experience similar mechanisms in reality. I have a reputation for having strategies for every situation in politics, and I almost always succeed in love. But I dare not be too casual, as I cannot guarantee flawless performance every moment. The first Archon of Time in history, Icarix, once used his power to deliberately seek favor from the Overlord. This disrespectful move was noticed, and he was assassinated by the Archon of Shadows that very night."
 dionysian_base.15.sercets: "§YAre you a mind reader?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.sercets.response: "Archons with the same title may still have more or less differences in power and personality. In the past, there were two vastly different Archons of Secrets: Kolynder was the Empire's earliest spymaster, his ears could eavesdrop on the thoughts of those walking around him, and his dark eyes could read the past of those standing before him; Nerat was a notorious soul-devouring monster, capable of directly plundering all the memories of his victims, gradually leading to a split in his personality. I am between these two seniors, how about keeping my specific abilities a secret for now?"
 dionysian_base.15.stone: "§YThe ability to manipulate stones is truly straightforward and sturdy.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.stone.response: "Throughout history, Archons of Stone have been steadfast and strong, with few peers able to directly challenge us. Our apprentices are equally reliable. The Empire has seen Earthshakers who can shatter city walls and tear apart mountain ranges, and Stone Knights where each member is a giant made of stone. Moreover, our traditional image has never been dull. Two thousand years ago, the Archon Carin was always abnormal. He was a hermit in the mountains before he became famous, silently fighting for the Overlord, only to betray [Root.Ruler.GetHerHim] on the verge of victory. He transformed into a towering titan rampaging everywhere and was buried by the Edict of Stone. Perhaps this was the ending he desired?"
 dionysian_base.15.fire: "§YThe Archon of Fire is like a popular title.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.fire.response: "The Sigil of Fire is ancient, extensively studied by various nations long before the Empire was born. It may be one of the earliest arcane spells or psychic abilities we mastered. However, Archons of Fire often have short lives because occasional geniuses rise among the many Mages. A typical example of this is Thousand Embers and Sun Queen. The place where the two had their decisive battle has a long river of magma that continues to this day. Such life-and-death duels are no longer tolerated, and the burning scar has become a tourist attraction."
 dionysian_base.15.wind: "§YWhat is the use of your power?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.wind.response: "I can transform into a tornado that touches the sky and walks the earth, disperse into gusts that caress everything in an instant, ride on clouds drifting everywhere... I can even do three things at same time, and perhaps in the future, I could blow planets out of orbit. But with the advancement of technology, magic does show signs of becoming a relic. We must pursue stronger power, or else we will eventually be scorned, overthrown, and forgotten by mortals."
 dionysian_base.15.entropy: "§YThe domain you control is Entropy?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.entropy.response: "My apprentices can rust swords and disintegrate spacecraft, and my fingers can turn crying infants into crying old men. This may not necessarily be described as Entropy; there are perhaps more fitting words. However, mortal beliefs can influence our psychic powers and physical bodies to some extent. Some Archons have been deeply fearful for centuries, gradually transforming into monsters even in appearance. Essentially, the titles of Archons are not meant to reflect reality but to guide the masses, much like political propaganda."
 dionysian_base.15.dream: "§YHow do you view dreams?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.dream.response: "My dreams are a realm where I can do as I please, a perpetual temptation. About two thousand years ago, the Archon of Dream named Magno was addicted to sleep, often gathering with relatives and friends in his hallucinations. He was the first governor to be declared incompetence by the Overlord. However, considering his rare involvement in the bloody reality of our Empire, he may have been one of the closest to innocence."
 dionysian_base.15.war: "§YThe Archon of War, truly glorious.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.war.response: "Looking back at several Archons of War in history: Agathon, the commander of the Imperial Guards; Blood Ruin, chieftain of the Southern Barbarians; and Ashe, father of the Disfavored Legion. They all have transcended mortal bounds by traversing mountains of corpses and seas of blood, and later, all have orchestrated countless massacres for the Overlord. Yet, Agathon's loyalty was immortalized in history, Blood Ruin's valor shaked the world, and Graven Ashe remembered the names of every soldier in his army, using magic to transfer their wounds to himself. We all have some heroic aspect, and such evaluations should be apt."
 dionysian_base.15.justice: "§YHow do you understand justice?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.justice.response: "In the past, the standard answer to this question was that justice existed in the laws of the Overlord. The first Archon of Justice, Tunon the Adjudicator, was a machine dedicated entirely to serving the Overlord, almost a demigod devoid of personal desires. I admire his dedication; for over four hundred years, he maintained a solemn demeanor, wearing a mask to conceal his expressions. But now, it seems that the concept of justice should not be monopolized. I can affirm this."
 dionysian_base.15.rebirth: "§YThe Archon who guides vitality, comforting indeed.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.rebirth.response: "Most of my predecessors were healers, bringing life wherever they went. However, there are always exceptions: the healing power of Orphan Midwife sometimes drived patients into madness, and the artist Thalia can temporarily infuse spirituality into animals and plants. We often have strained relationships with the Overlord, beacuse [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] is the one who caused the most death and injury in history undoubtedly. Several Archons of Rebirth have been permanently imprisoned and had their powers drained for minor mistakes."
 dionysian_base.15.song: "§YWhat power lies within songs?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.song.response: "Emotions, beliefs, imagination, memories, these are all things I can manipulate. My subtle suggestions can compel listeners to obey urgently, and my music albums can influence the collective spirit. There was once an Archon of Song, Sirin, who attempted to command the Overlord to commit suicide with her melodies, nearly succeeding. She was treated as a tool for accumulating wealth by her father since childhood and later sold into the imperial palace, walking on thin ice."
 dionysian_base.15.virus: "§YWhat kind of person would become the Archon of Virus?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.virus.response: "The Archons of Virus are generally varying degrees of antisocial deviants. Among us, the most infamous is Ter, the founder of the Plague Monastery, who conducted experiments on civilians with the Overlord's tacit approval. He claimed that he did so to eradicate his moral and pursue a state of ruthless cruelty. He was defeated and killed in battle against the Archon of Fire, the Self-burning Saint, a lesson I have to learn from."
 dionysian_base.15.shadows: "§YShadow is the domain of assassins, right?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.shadows.response: "My predecessors have killed the most Archons and countless unnamed mortals. We rarely govern a province or lead an army in the light. Among the historical works written by the Sage Lantry, one Archon of Shadows, Bleden Mark, is widely known. He attempted to assassinate the Overlord but failed, instead pledging allegiance to [Root.Ruler.GetHerHim]. He possessed lethal skills and charming demeanor, garnering numerous admirers in later generations."
 dionysian_base.15.domination: "§YDomination seems to be the power of the Overlord.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.domination.response: "Calling the Overlord an Archon is like calling an Archon a mere mortal, which in the past would have cost one person's tongue. However, the Overlord indeed appears to be an Archon of Domination or Tyranny. I guess [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] tolerates the existence of some evil Archons like me in the world, perhaps to divert the people's hatred. [Root.GetRulerName] attempts to portray [Root.Ruler.GetHerHim]self as someone who incarcerates and drives savage beasts. Without [Root.Ruler.GetHerHis] restraint, more ruthless supernaturals would mercilessly enslave sentient beings. Whether willingly or not, I must play the role of the antagonist."
 dionysian_base.15.wisdom: "§YThe Archon of Wisdom is likely a wise individual?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.wisdom.response: "Many of my predecessors were scholars and philosophers, masters of various schools of thought, and even prophets of civilization's progress. The ideologies of the Overlord and the grandeur of the Empire have both been significantly influenced by us. However, [Root.GetRulerName] remains as cunning as ever in this regard. Sometimes [Root.Ruler.GetSheHe] skillfully distorts the teachings of the Archons of Wisdom, or merely adopts certain aspects of them to serve [Root.Ruler.GetHerHis] own interests."
 dionysian_base.15.frost: "§YDo you have an ice-bound palace?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.frost.response: "When I'm happy, I summon snowfall, so everyone knows. During celebrations, I create ice sculptures resembling phoenixes or dragons and set them dancing in the sky above cities. The element I control no longer have much destructive power in the age of space. But I strive for artistic expression, living comfortably, at least not morally corrupt. There once was an Archon of Frost in history whose palace was filled with frozen beauties collected from various places."
 dionysian_base.15.death: "§YThe Archon of Death, perhaps infamous?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.death.response: "Some people attributed the passing of loved ones to me, while some suicides cursed me in their dying moments. But I welcome such infamy to some extent because the fear from people can enhance the power of us Archons. Some of my colleagues worry about losing their influence in the age of space, but I don't have to fret over that. Death is still inevitable for modern people."
 dionysian_base.15.light: "§YHonored to the utmost, the sovereign of radiant light.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.light.response: "Fear of darkness is almost innate to creatures, and the image of my predecessors has always been favorable in the eyes of the masses. Several previous Archons of Light were described as having immaculate skin and behaving like divine beings. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that we are virtuous; it simply makes it easier for us to gain political resources. Most of us still bow to the Overlord, and in power struggles, we are not fundamentally different from other Archons."
 dionysian_base.15.thunder: "§YControlling thunder, it's a power that shakes hearts.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.thunder.response: "I can announce my name with booming thunder, much like the traditional Gods of Lightning. I can also linger within endless circuits, as the scientific revolution of the past few centuries has surrounded people with various types of machinery. In the modern era, many unprecedented Archons have emerged, such as Archon of Network and Archon of Games. My long-standing traditional skills have been updated accordingly, which is quite remarkable."
 dionysian_base.15.forge: "§YThe magic of forge must have a long history, right?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.forge.response: "Indeed, the Forge-Bounds crafted weapons and armors for the Empire a long time ago.These individuals used magical rituals to expand their senses, turning hammers and forges into additional limbs that they can control with ease. The Archons of Forge are even more powerful; we can precisely control every detail of several factories, as if we have become Gestalt Consciousness. Historically, there were indeed three Archons who abandoned their physical bodies, transferring their consciousness to the depths of underground foundries to spend the rest of their lives there, where they could smelt extremely tough steel."
 dionysian_base.15.temptation: "§YWhat forms of temptation are there?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.temptation.response: "It's hard to sum up, really. It's better to ask how deep, complex, and dangerous the souls can be. Like the Archons of Temptation before me, I've been something of a seller of talents and bodies. Sometimes, I find the world intolerably mundane, while at other times, it seems filled with naive children begging for curious and whimsical gifts. I try to satisfy them because it's the power bestowed upon me, as if the devil are born to lead mortals astray."
 dionysian_base.15.order: "§YThe power of order undoubtedly contributes greatly to the Empire.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.order.response: "The Empire has spread across the continent around Year 400, and managing it properly has always been a challenge since ancient times. Many Archons were lords who indulged in pleasure within their territories, while my predecessors typically served as advisors to the Overlord. Common folk naturally believe: we are somewhat arrogant yet wise, using superhuman foresight and meticulous planning to achieve the happiness of the community. I can't say the reality matches this exactly, but I'll do my best to meet these expectations."
 dionysian_base.15.hatred: "§YMay your hatred be directed towards our enemies.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.hatred.response: "In truth, my abilities are quite diverse; igniting anger is just the most basic manifestation. It's more interesting to twist others into cruel, bloodthirsty beasts or vampires indulging in wanton carnage. Generally, my followers crave conflict; they care neither for their own dignity nor for the consequences of exterminating their prey. But we know to bow before the strong, and we will obey before the Overlord weakens."
 dionysian_base.15.watchers: "§YWhat abilities do the Watchers possess?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.watchers.response: "We can do more than just extract memories from skeletons like the Archon of Death; we can also see what happened in a certain place, learn about the experiences of the owner of an object. We are suited for adventurous archaeology; some Archons of Watchers have achieved great success in this regard and then received commendation from the Overlord, enjoying their later years in a castle. Perhaps I will repeat such experiences, spending my twilight years writing memoirs in a mansion on some distant planet."
 dionysian_base.15.nature: "§YCould the Archon of Nature be the leader of environmentalists?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.nature.response: "The rise of modern environmental movements has indeed strengthened my power and even changed our usual ways. Ancient Archons of Nature were mostly eccentric recluses who lived in swamps or forests all year round, ostensibly obeying the Overlord but in reality having little to do with the mundane world. Those predecessors lived quietly, surrounded by birds and beasts, probably never imagining that their successors would be giving speeches in the media and traveling among the stars."
 dionysian_base.15.foison: "§YAre you the harbinger of abundance?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.foison.response: "In modern terms, I'd be considered an agricultural expert, wouldn't I? Archons are almost incarnations of certain concepts. Agriculture has always been the foundation of civilization. I may not shine on the battlefield, but ample food always has its uses. In the past, I could even curse enemy crops, but with interstellar empires, that spell is obsolete."
 dionysian_base.15.fortune: "§YYou certainly possess extraordinary wealth.§!"
 dionysian_base.15.fortune.response: "Some are born Archons, others ascend to the title. Born Archons of Fortune are rare; most of my predecessors were legendary tycoons, who amassed wealth that shook the world and then ascended. Our title signifies social inequality, yet our path among the Archons is relatively equal."
 dionysian_base.15.creation: "§YAre you an outstanding craftsman?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.creation.response: "I can turn stone into gold, and then gold into art. Without the succession of Archons of Creation and their apprentices, many magnificent buildings that have endured to this day would not exist in the Empire. Perhaps our power could reach even greater heights, reshaping the structure of the entire world, or creating new universes. This has certainly been a dream that has eluded realization for a long time."
 dionysian_base.15.rifts: "§YCan you control the Astral Rifts?§!"
 dionysian_base.15.rifts.response: "I can tear open and close extremely narrow Astral Rifts, while there are broader Rifts in the universe. If I could delve deeper into them, perhaps I would achieve another Ascension and become the Archon of Astral Planes... only to be eradicated by the Overlord due to the threat I posed. The strength of Archons may not always be comparable; long ago, there was a legendary Archon who was besieged by six other Archons and managed to kill five before her death. It is said that there have even been an Archon capable of issuing Edicts."

 dionysian_story.100.desc: "The Archons have always been pioneers and dominators in the field of psychic powers. In the past, ordinary people must rely on the Sigils from them to cast magic. However, after the Great Awakening, this necessity no longer exists. Now, anyone is a psychic.\n\nThese newcomers are widely scattered across various industries, lacking experience and exhibiting significant diversity. Empowering Archons to organize them would undoubtedly improve productivity. We can also choose to rely more on the masses, taking advantage of the situation to balance and weaken Archons."

The optimism in society has diminished.\n\nMeanwhile, the voices opposing the status quo are growing louder.

While the Overlord's promise of enduring peace may be riddled with flaws, there have been no shortage of glorious battles over the past thousands of years.

 dionysian_story.501.desc: "Our recent decision has sparked widespread discussion, with one theory in particular gaining significant attention. Archons are unparalleled distorters of reality, capable of aiding the Empire in unraveling the mysteries of universe and exploring advanced logic. However, even they will suffer in this process, and the entire elite group will harbor resentment as a result. Relatively weaker Archons may risk exhausting their psychic powers and perishing.

They are closely tied to flesh, and simply installing cyberwares will stifle the potential of most psychics. However, the Archons' privileges have already been inscribed in Shroud during their ascension.

In hindsight, this was a naive form of self-consolation. Celestial bodies are equally under [Root.Ruler.GetHerHis] control, just as the land once cracked under [Root.Ruler.GetHerHis] decree. Some people remain silent out of fear, some worry that the Galaxy will eventually become riddled with scars, while others express their joy with fervent enthusiasm.\n\nRegardless, we still possess the advantage that has existed since ancient times, as if standing in an invincible position."
